## Local building

1. Install NodeJS with NPM (https://nodejs.org/uk/ 12 version);
2. Clone repository into any directory;
3. `cd road-helper` (go to cloned directory);
4. `npm install` (once after every pull from repository);
5. `npm start`;
6. go to `localhost:3000`.

## Run static server with prod build

1. `npm install -g serve` <- do it once to install package globally (after install on Node with NPM);
2. run `build.ps1`;
3. go to `localhost:3001`.
